# FlockingBehaviorExperiment
Playing around with simulating flocks of animals back in 2012.

## Usage
Just open [index.html](https://github.com/kujon/FlockingBehaviorExperiment/blob/master/index.html) in your browser and have fun.

## Algorithm
I don't remember off the top of my head which exact algorithm is used, but it's likely very similar to [this](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/modeling-natural-systems/boids.html).
